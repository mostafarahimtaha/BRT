- **Cleaning**: Handles nulls, parses dates, extracts time features  

### Exploratory Analysis (EDA):
- Gender and Age distribution  
- Tap-in hour behavior (weekday vs. weekend)  
- Revenue trends by age group and payment method  
- Daily revenue fluctuations  

### Sample Insights:
- “Friday has the highest total revenue (18.0M IDR)”  
- “The adult group generates the most revenue (56.2M IDR)”
